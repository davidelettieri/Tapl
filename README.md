# Tapl
I'm trying to implement the snippets from all the chapters "An ML implementation of *" using C#. Each chapter will have 2 project, one for the implementation, one for the tests. 

The OCaml implementation can be found at the book website https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/, I'm not strictly following that implementation since I'm looking at the code inside the book, moreover I'll use ANTLR to parse the text.
